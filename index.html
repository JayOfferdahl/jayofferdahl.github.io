                        <h2>About</h2>
                        <p>I'm a computer science undergraduate at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, KS. I'm entering my senior year towards a bachelor's degree program at KU's School of Engineering. I'm also the president of the information security club at KU, also known as the Jayhackers. We travel/host cyber defense competitons at least twice a year, hold practical lab exercises, and invite industry professionals to speak at our meetings. Aside from security, I've always been interested in space &amp; deep sea exploration, as well as web/mobile application development.</p>

                        <p>Over the last three years I've learned more about computer science than I ever thought I would back in high school. Recently, while interning at Cerner, I participated in Cerner's intern "Hackfest", which puts groups of interns against eachother in a weeklong hackathon. After several caffiene filled nights, my team and I won second place for our vocabulary tracking application, Confluency. The purpose of the application is to track children's vocabulary over time, and to give insightful analytics of the collected data.</p>

                        <p>Outside of school &amp; work, I enjoy my fair share of videogames, seeing movies, working out, warm weather, hiking, and hanging out with friends and family.</p>

                        <h3>Hackfest 2016 (Confluency)</h3>
                        <p>As mentioned above, Hackfest 2016 was a week-long hackathon put on by Cerner for the interns. My team, consisting of myself and three other KU undergraduates, took second place with our app: Confluency.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of Confluency is to track children's vocabulary development over time. Our original goal for the week was to connect out GUI/back-end with IBM Watson's speech to text API, which would allow us to take audio from a child's conversation, and convert it to text so we could perform analytical calculations on it in order to show a description of that child's progress. We ended up fleshing out the GUI/back-end to offer a proof of concept before the week concluded.</p>
                        <p>With this app, a user can view their children, each child's conversation history, as well as analytics on all conversations. Users can also record conversations and save them to a specific child.</p>
                        <p>We used the Ionic framework to build this application, which is built off of Angular.js and Cordova, and is made for mobile/web application development. For this project, I worked on both front-end and back-end, and spent quite a bit of time learning the Ionic framework.</p>

                        <h3>Developer (YourToDo)</h3>
                        <p>My colleagues and I created a web application build on django which categorically organized events in a planner. We created three layouts, day, week, and month, and are planning on adding more in the future. The application allows users to neatly plan out their lives while keeping certain aspects of it grouped together, such as school, gym, work, or any other breakdown.</p>
                        <p>For this project, I was mainly focused on front-end development, and I also helped with setting up the back-end and database. In the end, I learned a lot about several of the packages we implemented, which consisted of django, python, bootstrap, and ajax, as well as more. I'm excited to continue developing this application for the future.</p>
                        <p>YourToDo isn't on a production server yet, but that's one of our primary goals for the future.</p>

                        <p class="section-text">After working at The Big Biscuit for over two years as a cook &amp; server, I approached them about designing and developing a brand new site. I had a lot of fun designing and deploying the original site. However, after being stuck with a static site for nearly a year, I rebuilt the site on Angular.js, a framework for one-page web applications, which greatly improved traversing the site, as well as ease of maintainability.<br /><br />
                        I still continue to make updates to the website and improve functionality where I can. I also create graphics for use on the site and The Big Biscuit's social media.<br /><br />
