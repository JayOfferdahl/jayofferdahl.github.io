I figure it will make keeping track of all of my side projects and school struggles a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, I’ve setup a pretty basic project, which you’re viewing now, on Jekyll. Jekyll is basically a tool that takes text documents and turns them into a functional static website. As I write this page, I’m literally editing a text file with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.markdown&lt;/code&gt; extension which will then be interpretted by Jekyll and formatted like any normal blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from getting the blog up and running, I migrated my static portfolio home page over to this domain. My intentions were to port my personal site to a django application, with room to build more applications on the side in the future. However, I have decided to use Jekyll for this project for its seamless integration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve somehow made it here without viewing my portfolio, take a look &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve been wanting to start blog for a while now.
