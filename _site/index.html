                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>I'm a software engineer in the first year of my career. I recently graduated from the University of Kansas School of Engineering with a bachelor's degree in computer science. While my time at college was a blast and I learned more than I ever thought I would back in highschool, I'm excited to finally be in industry and can't wait to see where it takes me.</p>

                    <p>Over the past few years, I've had the opportunity to work at some amazing companys as well as work on some pretty cool projects. You can read more about what I've been up to below.</p>

                    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy my fair share of videogames, watching movies, warm weather, and hanging out with friends and family.</p>

                    <h3>Software Engineer Intern (Cerner)</h3>
                    <p>This summer I had the amazing opportunity to work at Cerner, here in Kansas City. I was part of the Pharmacy In-Patient team. During my time at Cerner I worked on java back-end services that allowed our team's projects to communicate quickly and efficiently with the databases. I wrote several unit tests and functional tests in order to ensure correct functionality with the services. I then added functionality to the search API that allowed pharmacists to search for products. It was extremely rewarding to be able to contribute code to a full-fledged enterprise project.</p>

                    <p>About halfway through the summer, I switched gears and started working on a few of my team's front-end applications, which were written mostly in C# which implemented XAML. I'm glad I was able to get to see the whole picture from back-end to front-end in just one summer.</p>

                    <p>This internship allowed me to expand the skills I had picked up from previous experiences, and also learn a lot more about enterprise development, working with a team, and a multitude of high level technologies which I can now use confidently.</p>

I was on the Automotive Personal Navigation Device Maintenance team (AutoPND). This internship provided me with several software development skills: version control, code review processes, and large-scale product development.</p>

                    <p>I also had the opportunity to collaborate with several full-time software engineers on a variety of issues and projects, which really helped me see into the professional world of software development as well as prepare me for larger projects.</p>

                    <p class="section-text">After working at The Big Biscuit for over two years as a cook/server, I approached them about designing and developing a brand new site. I had a lot of fun designing and deploying the original site. However, after being stuck with a static site for nearly a year, I rebuilt the site on Angular.js, a framework for one-page web applications, which greatly improved traversing the site, as well as ease of maintainability.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm currently working on a complete redesign to provide more consistency between the mobile and desktop sites. For this project, I plan on using React.js and Bootstrap as my frameworks. Aside from web development, I also create graphics for use on the site and The Big Biscuit's social media.</p>

                    <h3>Senior Design (Managr)</h3>
                    <p>For my team's senior design project, we chose to create Managr: a project management application aimed at simplifying the connection between project managers and their clients.</p>
                    <p>The first semester in our capstone class was aimed primarily at designing our application and planning out the steps in which we would bring it to life. The second semester was for implementation. That said, we spent quite a lot of time putting together a functional application on paper, which made it pretty easy to implement when actually coding it.</p>
                    <p>As far as the functionality of Managr, we had several workflows which allowed potential 'clients' to pitch project ideas to our 'contractor' network. Contractors would bid on these projects, which would be viewable by the client. Once a project bid was accepted, the project was made and both parties could see information such as fiances, milestones, labor, etc.</p>
                    <p>In the end, we made a pretty cool application that had all of the features we intended it to have when designing it. Aside from that, we learned a lot about the technologies we used, which included Facebook's React.js front-end framework, Django as a backend framework, and PostgreSQL as our database.</p>

                    <p>Hackfest 2016 was a week-long hackathon put on by Cerner for the interns. My team, consisting of myself and three other KU undergraduates, took second place with our app: Confluency.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of Confluency is to track children's vocabulary development over time. Our original goal for the week was to connect out GUI/back-end with IBM Watson's speech to text API, which would allow us to take audio from a child's conversation, and convert it to text so we could perform analytical calculations on it in order to show a description of that child's progress. We ended up fleshing out the GUI/back-end to offer a proof of concept before the week concluded.</p>
                    <p>With this app, a user can view their children, each child's conversation history, as well as analytics on all conversations. Users can also record conversations and save them to a specific child.</p>
                    <p>We used the Ionic framework to build this application, which is built off of Angular.js and Cordova, and is made for mobile/web application development. For this project, I worked on both front-end and back-end, and spent quite a bit of time learning the Ionic framework.</p>

                    <p>My colleagues and I created a web application build on Django which categorically organized events in a planner. We created three layouts, day, week, and month, and are planning on adding more in the future. The application allows users to neatly plan out their lives while keeping certain aspects of it grouped together, such as school, gym, work, or any other breakdown.</p>
                    <p>For this project, I was mainly focused on front-end development, and I also helped with setting up the back-end and database. I spent a lot of time working on vital calendar functions such as a miniature calendar which was displayed on each of the views. This mini-cal allowed users to quickly select a date and view that day/week/month in their planner. In the end, I learned a lot about several of the packages we implemented, which consisted of django, python, bootstrap, and ajax, to name a few. I'm excited to continue developing this application for the future.</p>

                    <p>I joined KUISC in the beginning of the spring 2015 semester. The purpose of the club is to train students in the ability to properly secure and defend home and enterprise systems, present industry speakers, and provide students with access to a network of professionals in the cyber security field.</p>

                    <p>After I joined the club, I was invited to be part of the competition team that travels to regional qualifiers and workshops to compete in cyber defense competitions. Since joining, I've traveled with the team to several competitions, including the Rocky Mountain and "At Large" regional qualifiers, two Central Area Networking and Security workshops, and two of Iowa State's cyber defense competitions.</p>

                    <p>During the spring 2016 semester, I took over as president, and worked to coordinate several events here at KU. Since then, the club has hosted the First Infantry Division stationed in Fort Riley, KS as part of two "Cyber Blitz" events. We have also hosted a National Science Foundation sponsored GenCyber summer camp, which aimed to educate teachers about ways to bring cyber security concepts into their students lives, while also giving them hands on skills related to information 
                    security.</p>

                    <p>After graduating, I officially became a 'legacy' member of the club. I look forward to helping the crew out with their upcoming competitions as much as I can, and can only say that I am happy to have been a part of such a phenomenal group of people.</p>
