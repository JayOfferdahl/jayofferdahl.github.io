                        I'm a computer science undergraduate at The University of Kansas in Lawrence, KS. Currently, I'm in my second year of a four year program that is constantly aiding me in my journey into the world of technology.<br /><br />
						Before my involvement with computer science I was still really attached to computers. I put together my own gaming rig in the fall of 2011 over the course of several hours and countless re-reading of the manuals. Now, I have helped friends and family piece together computers in a fraction of the time.<br /><br />
						What really got me interested in development were the classes I took in high school. My high school offered many classes in a separate building called the career center. These classes were aimed toward actual careers in modern society. As a junior who had no idea at all what I wanted after high school, I thought it would be interesting to take a class called Digital Media at the career center. This class offered introductions to a lot of Adobe's creative suite software, as well as introductions to many different concepts of design. After enjoying Digital Media so much, I then decided to take Web Design, Graphic Design, and the Digital Video classes. However, I still didn't have a full schedule.<br /><br />
						Being very satisfied with the career center, I enrolled in two intro-level programming classes: Introduction to C++ and AP Computer Science A. These were the two classes I enjoyed most throughout the entirety of my public education, as they challenged me in ways that I had never been before. Learning the fundamentals of computer science really stretched my imagination, as I had never been exposed to this world before. Now, I can see myself creating and developing the next big thing.
