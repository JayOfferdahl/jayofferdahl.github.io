I've been wanting to start blog for a while now. I figure it will make keeping track of all of my side projects and school struggles a lot easier. 

To start, I've setup a pretty basic project, which you're viewing now, on Jekyll. Jekyll is basically a tool that takes text documents and turns them into a functional static website. As I write this page, I'm literally editing a text file with a `.markdown` extension which will then be interpretted by Jekyll and formatted like any normal blog post.

Aside from getting the blog up and running, I migrated my static portfolio home page over to this domain. My intentions were to port my personal site to a django application, with room to build more applications on the side in the future. However, I have decided to use Jekyll for this project for its seamless integration with [Github Pages][github-pages].

If you've somehow made it here without viewing my portfolio, take a look [here][portfolio-site]!
