                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>I'm a computer science undergraduate at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, KS, and I'm nearly done with my senior year in my journey towards a bachelor's degree at the KU School of Engineering. Throughout my time at KU, I've learned much more than I ever thought I would back in highschool. It has certainly been a ride, and I'm excited to finally get into the industry.</p>

                    <p>At school, I'm the president of the Information Security Club, known as the JayHackers. We travel to and host cyber defense competitions at least twice a year, hold practical lab exercises, and invite industry professionals to speak at our meetings. Aside from security, I've always been excited about web and mobile application development.</p>

                    <p>Over the last three and a half years I've learned quite a lot about computer science through internships and outside projects, in addition to school work. Last summer, while interning at Cerner, I participated in Cerner's intern "Hackfest", which puts groups of interns against each other in a weeklong hackathon. After several caffeine filled nights, my team and I won second place for our vocabulary tracking application, Confluency. The purpose of the application is to track children's vocabulary over time, and to give insightful analytics of the collected data.</p>

                    <p>Outside of school and work, I enjoy my fair share of videogames, watching movies, warm weather, hiking, and hanging out with friends and family.</p>

                    <h3>Software Engineer Intern (Cerner)</h3>
                    <p>This summer I had the amazing opportunity to work at Cerner, here in Kansas City. I was part of the Pharmacy In-Patient team. During my time at Cerner I worked on java back-end services that allowed our team's projects to communicate quickly and efficiently with the databases. I wrote several unit tests and functional tests in order to ensure correct functionality with the services. I then added functionality to the search API that allowed pharmacists to search for products. It was extremely rewarding to be able to contribute code to a full-fledged enterprise project.</p>

                    <p>About halfway through the summer, I switched gears and started working on a few of my team's front-end applications, which were written mostly in C# which implemented XAML. I'm glad I was able to get to see the whole picture from back-end to front-end in just one summer.</p>

                    <p>This internship allowed me to expand the skills I had picked up from previous experiences, and also learn a lot more about enterprise development, working with a team, and a multitude of high level technologies which I can now use confidently.</p>

This internship provided me with several software development skills: version control, code review processes, and large-scale product development.</p>

                    <p>I also had the opportunity to collaborate with several full-time software engineers on a variety of issues and projects, which really helped me see into the professional world of software development as well as prepare me for larger projects.</p>

                    <p class="section-text">After working at The Big Biscuit for over two years as a cook/server, I approached them about designing and developing a brand new site. I had a lot of fun designing and deploying the original site. However, after being stuck with a static site for nearly a year, I rebuilt the site on Angular.js, a framework for one-page web applications, which greatly improved traversing the site, as well as ease of maintainability.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm currently working on a complete redesign to provide more consistency between the mobile and desktop sites, and I'm incorporating django as my framework of choice. Aside from web development, I also create graphics for use on the site and The Big Biscuit's social media.</p>

                    <p>As mentioned above, Hackfest 2016 was a week-long hackathon put on by Cerner for the interns. My team, consisting of myself and three other KU undergraduates, took second place with our app: Confluency.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of Confluency is to track children's vocabulary development over time. Our original goal for the week was to connect out GUI/back-end with IBM Watson's speech to text API, which would allow us to take audio from a child's conversation, and convert it to text so we could perform analytical calculations on it in order to show a description of that child's progress. We ended up fleshing out the GUI/back-end to offer a proof of concept before the week concluded.</p>
                    <p>With this app, a user can view their children, each child's conversation history, as well as analytics on all conversations. Users can also record conversations and save them to a specific child.</p>
                    <p>We used the Ionic framework to build this application, which is built off of Angular.js and Cordova, and is made for mobile/web application development. For this project, I worked on both front-end and back-end, and spent quite a bit of time learning the Ionic framework.</p>

                    <p>My colleagues and I created a web application build on Django which categorically organized events in a planner. We created three layouts, day, week, and month, and are planning on adding more in the future. The application allows users to neatly plan out their lives while keeping certain aspects of it grouped together, such as school, gym, work, or any other breakdown.</p>
                    <p>For this project, I was mainly focused on front-end development, and I also helped with setting up the back-end and database. I spent a lot of time working on vital calendar functions such as a miniature calendar which was displayed on each of the views. This mini-cal allowed users to quickly select a date and view that day/week/month in their planner. In the end, I learned a lot about several of the packages we implemented, which consisted of django, python, bootstrap, and ajax, to name a few. I'm excited to continue developing this application for the future.</p>

                    <p>I joined KUISC in the beginning of the spring 2015 semester. The purpose of the club is to train students in the ability to properly secure and defend home and enterprise systems, present industry speakers, and provide students with access to a network of professionals in the cyber security field.</p>

                    <p>After I joined the club, I was invited to be part of the competition team that travels to regional qualifiers and workshops to compete in cyber defense competitions. Since joining, I've traveled with the team to several competitions, including the Rocky Mountain and "At Large" regional qualifiers, two Central Area Networking and Security workshops, and Iowa State's cyber defense competition.</p>

                    <p>During the spring 2016 semester, I took over as president, and have been working to coordinate several events here at KU. Since then, the club has hosted the First Infantry Division stationed in Fort Riley, KS as part of two "Cyber Blitz" events. We have also hosted a National Science Foundation sponsored GenCyber summer camp, which aimed to educate teachers about ways to bring cyber security concepts into their students lives, while also giving them hands on skills related to information 
                    security.</p>

                    <p>So far this semester, the competition team has participated in two competitions (ISUCDC &amp; ALCCDC), and has also hosted several high school students, undergraduates from KU, and soldiers from the First Infantry Division for the second Cyber Blitz. While our activity may be cooling down for the school year, we look forward to the challenges and opportunities that another year brings in the fall.</p>
